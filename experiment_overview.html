				Hello! Thank you for your interest in our study.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are interested to find out your impression of realness on some stimuli that have been taken by different cameras.
				You will see each image briefly <span style="font-weight: bold;">(1 second)</span>, then we will ask you to rate 
				how real you perceived the image based on a rating scale from <span style="font-weight: bold;">-4 (most unreal) to 4 (most real) </span>.
				Following this, you will be prompted to complete a short survey about your everyday reality experience.
			</p>

			<p>This experiment will take approximately 30 minutes of your time. Don't worry! Further instructions will be provided before the experiment starts, and you get a practice trials.</p>

			<p>All data will be kept confidential. If you have any question at this stage, please contact the investigators above.</p>
